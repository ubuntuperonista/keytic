## Installing keyting

Keytic does not replaces the original Blinkenspring sounds. It adds a new sound theme with a DEC VT terminal keypress tic.
To install, simply copy the <file>keytic/</file> folder in the Bucklespring wav file (i.e. <file>/usr/share/buckle/wav/</file>)

## Using Keytic 

Start Bucklespring with the **-p** option directing to the alternative keytic sound theme path:

<code>
/usr/games/buckle -p /usr/share/buckle/wav/keytic/
</code>
